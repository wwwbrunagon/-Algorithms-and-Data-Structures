## Add 1 To Array Elements
Given an array of numbers like write a function that returns a new array where each element of the original array is incremented by 1.
For example, of the input is:

`[1, 2, 3]`


The output is:
`[2, 3, 4]`


You are expected to use `Array.prototype.map` to implement the solution.
